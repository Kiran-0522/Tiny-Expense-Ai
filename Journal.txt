# Journal: My Expense Tracker Journey

---

## 🧠 What I Tried

- Started with a basic CLI structure using Python's built-in input and dictionary.
- Followed a checklist to avoid folder mix-ups and ensure clean structure.
- Used Notepad to manually create `requirements.txt` and `README.md` for clarity.

---

## 🔍 What Worked

- CLI tracker runs smoothly and handles invalid input gracefully.
- GitHub repo is public, organized, and includes all required files.
- Streamlit UI file added as optional enhancement.

---

## ❌ What Didn't Work Initially

- Faced confusion with README formatting — resolved using AI guidance.
- Streamlit UI layout needed adjustment — fixed after testing locally.

---

## 🤖 How I Used AI

- Asked for step-by-step guidance on file structure, documentation, and polish.
- Got help writing clean README and journal content.
- Used AI to confirm assignment requirements and match them to my repo.
